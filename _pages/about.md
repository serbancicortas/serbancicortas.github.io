## About me

I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.math.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. My advisor is [Igor Rodnianski](https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/igor-rodnianski).

My research interests are partial differential equations, general relativity, and nonlinear wave equations. I am currently working on self similar solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations. I am also interested in the weak cosmic censorship conjecture and examples of naked singularities.

## Publications

"2." Scattering for the Wave Equation on de Sitter Space in All Even Spatial Dimensions, submitted, [arXiv:2309.07342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07342)

(1.) Extensions of Lorentzian Hawking--Page Solutions with Null Singularities, Spacelike Singularities, and Cauchy horizons of Taub--NUT type, submitted, [arXiv:2209.06134](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06134)

## Resume

PhD in Mathematics, Princeton University, 

Here is my complete resume.

## Seminar
I organize the weekly Princeton-Cambridge Joint General Relativity Seminar. Please contact me if you would like to join the seminar.

## Teaching
During Fall 2023 I am a preceptor for [MAT 175 Mathematics for Economics/Life Sciences](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1242&courseid=012060).

Previously, I was a TA for [MAT 335 Analysis II: Complex Analysis](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1242&courseid=004194) and [MAT 425 Analysis III: Integration Theory and Hilbert Spaces](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1234&courseid=008172).
