## About me

I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.math.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. My advisor is [Igor Rodnianski](https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/igor-rodnianski).

My research interests are partial differential equations, general relativity, and nonlinear wave equations. I am currently working on self similar solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations. I am also interested in the weak cosmic censorship conjecture and examples of naked singularities.

## Teaching
During Fall 2023 I am a preceptor for [MAT 175 Mathematics for Economics/Life Sciences](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1242&courseid=012060).

Previously, I was a TA for [MAT 335 Analysis II: Complex Analysis](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1242&courseid=004194) and [MAT 425 Analysis III: Integration Theory and Hilbert Spaces](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1234&courseid=008172).
