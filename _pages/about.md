I am a 5th year PhD student in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.math.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. My advisor is [Igor Rodnianski](https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/igor-rodnianski).

My research interests are partial differential equations, general relativity, and nonlinear wave equations. I am currently working on self similar solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations. I am also interested in the weak cosmic censorship conjecture and examples of naked singularities.

### I am currently in the postdoc job market.

I organize the weekly Princeton-Cambridge Joint General Relativity Seminar. Please contact me if you would like to join the seminar.

## Teaching

During Fall 2025 I am a TA for [MAT 335 Analysis II: Complex Analysis](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1252&courseid=004194).

During Summer 2024, I was an instructor for the [SLMath Summer School "Mathematics of General Relativity and Fluids"](https://general-relativity-fluids-school.iacm.forth.gr/).

Previously, I was a preceptor for [MAT 175 Mathematics for Economics/Life Sciences](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1242&courseid=012060), [MAT 201 Multivariable Calculus](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1252&courseid=004149) and TA for [MAT 335 Analysis II: Complex Analysis](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1242&courseid=004194), [MAT 425 Analysis III: Integration Theory and Hilbert Spaces](https://registrar.princeton.edu/course-offerings/course-details?term=1234&courseid=008172).
